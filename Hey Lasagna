Hey lasagna, you look delicious,
But before I eat you,
Let's have a small talk
When I slice you into pieces,
You won't feel a thing,
If I curse you for your foul taste,
You won't give a shit,
When I ask you: why so sad?
You say what is that?
What is sadness, what is happiness?
What is love, what is hate?
I never went through trouble of saying something nice!
I never cared to understand what you're even tryna say,
Coz I'm so narcissistic,so endorsed in myself,
That I've got no time for you,
I'll die alone, let my body rot,
I am not able to fall in love,
Heart says :"Error 404:Not Found"
Then why do you cry lasagna?
Dunno bruh, I never cared to comprehend,
I just strived to taste good,
Ok,not good, but better than others.
And I couldn't do a thing about it,
So, I accepted it as my fate,
And learnt to live with it.
So I can't wait lasagna,
Damn it was delicious
